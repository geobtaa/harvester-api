## Understanding Our Metadata Harvesters

Our metadata harvesters are tools that gather records from different sources, like ArcGIS servers or other data websites, and prepare them for our collection. These harvesters are set up so they share a common process, but each source can have its own special steps when needed.

We have designed our harvesters like a recipe template:

- The common process (like the recipe steps) lives in one main file. It covers everything we almost always do: loading our schema, downloading data, turning it into a table, cleaning it up, checking for problems, and saving it to files.
- Each individual harvester (for example, for ArcGIS) builds on that common process. It can add or change steps in the recipe if needed, like adjusting the title of each record or dropping records missing important information.
- By setting them up this way, we only have to update the common parts of the process in one place, and every harvester will get those improvements automatically.
  
## Why we designed it like this

- It saves time: instead of copying and pasting the same process for every harvester, we have a single shared structure.
- It reduces mistakes: fixes or improvements to the main process instantly help every harvester.
- It’s easier to read: you only see what’s unique in each harvester, not pages of repeated code.

## What you’ll find in the harvesters

- A common process file, which contains the general steps that every harvester follows.
- Separate files for each harvester (like ArcGIS or PASDA), which focus only on what’s different or special about that source.

This design lets us handle both the shared and unique parts of harvesting metadata in a consistent way. Our goal is for future team members to understand what’s happening without needing to read every line of code.
